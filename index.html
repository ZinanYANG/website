        <h3><a href="https://github.com/ZinanYANG/DatabaseConnectionFactoryImplementation.git" target="_blank"> Database
            Connection Factory Implementation</a></h3>
        <p>
          The project was aimed at architecting a highly adaptable database connection utility using Java, which applies
          the factory design pattern to abstract the instantiation process of database connections. This design choice
          streamlines the connection process to various database systems such as Oracle, MySQL, SQL Server, and H2 by
          providing a unified interface.

          Key functionalities included the development of a generic DatabaseConnection interface to standardize the
          operations across different databases, promoting system extensibility and future-proofing against the
          introduction of new database technologies. The core of the system, a DatabaseConnectionFactory class, was
          engineered to conceal the instantiation logic for database connections, thereby separating the client's
          dependency on specific database implementations.

          The designed system showcased polymorphism, allowing the easy extension of the factory to support additional
          database types with minimal to no changes in the client codebase, significantly elevating the system's
          maintainability. The dynamic nature of the factory was also a critical feature, as it adeptly created
          connections based on runtime parameters, offering a flexible solution adept for use in versatile and
          multi-database environments. This project not only fortified database connectivity practices but also embodied
          principles of modern software design and architecture, emphasizing code modularity, scalability, and
          robustness.
